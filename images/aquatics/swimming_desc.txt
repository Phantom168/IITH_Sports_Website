IITH Swimming is a new club which started this year. Even without a swimming pool on our own, IITH has always put up a fight wherever we have gone. We have performed well in the recent Inter IIT swimming meets with contestant(s) entering event finals and securing positions of 5th, 6th 7th and 8th (in the last two years). We were competent enough to get ahead of some of the older IITs(where they have a proper swimming pool) in several events. Expectations will be high this time, as we now have a working swimming pool.
